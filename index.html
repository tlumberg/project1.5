        <h2 class="titles">About Me </h2>

                <p class="intro">I'm Tim! I am a Visual Communication Design Major here at Eastern Washington University. 
                    I am 25 years and currently live in Spokane, WA. 
                    I am big into cars and own a Volkswagen Jetta and a Volvo 740 wagon, that is used as my drift car.
                    I am also in the process of purchasing my first home, which will hopefully close on Oct 28th. </p>

        <h2 class="titles">Goals </h2>
        
                <p class="intro">My goal is to graduate Spring of 2017 and move into the Graphic Design Field. 
                I plan on either convincing my CEO to hire me on as the designer for our Brand Department, 
                or look into joining on at a firm. I plan on using my skills in photography to get in doing something
                other than just graphic design. </p>

                    <br><br>My favorite book is The Great Gatsby, I am not big into reading, 
                    but this book always keeps my attention and brings me back.
