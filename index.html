                <p class="intro">I'm Tim! I am a Visual Communication Design Major here at Eastern Washington University. 
                    I am 25 years and live in Spokane, WA.</p>

        <h2 class="titles">Goals</h2>
        
                <p class="intro">My goal is to graduate Spring of 2017 and move into the Graphic Design Field. 
                I plan on either convincing my CEO to hire me on as the designer for our Brand Department, 
                or look into joining on at a firm. I plan on using my skills in photography to get in doing something
                other than just graphic design. </p>
