            <p>I'm Tim! I am a Visual Communication Design Major here at Eastern Washington University. 
            I am 25 years and live in Spokane, WA.</p>
        
            <p>My goal is to graduate Spring of 2017 and move into the Graphic Design Field. 
            I plan on either convincing my CEO to hire me on as the designer for our Brand Department, 
            or look into joining on at a firm. I plan on using my skills in photography to get in doing something
            other than just graphic design. </p>
